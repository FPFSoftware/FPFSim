# FLArE
Simulation code for R&D of the FLArE detector

## To compile the code
* Create a new directory to contain the executables (assume the path is /path/to/build)
* Assume the path to the source code is /path/to/source
* To compile, you need to go to the build directory `cd /path/to/build`
* And then `cmake /path/to/source`
* Finally `make`
